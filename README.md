# Sentiment-Analysis-News-Headlines
## Introduction:
It is a demo of leveraging LSTM model to do sentiment analysis on news headlines of Chinese listed companies

## Process:
1. Remove stopwords in text file
2. Train a word2vec model based on both news headlines and articles
3. Embedded word2vec in LSTM model to predict the sentiment of a news headline

## Two Demos:
1. Train and test the algorithm on online shopping evaluations
2. Train and test the model on all the headlines we have to do prediction, where the accuracy rate reaches 81.8%
